base_prompt = '''
Given a single text prompt, you need to envision a multi-scene video by generating a sequence of stepwise prompts to describe the text prompt. For each step, you also need to generate the set of entities needed and describe the background scene where the video should occur. Related steps should maintain similar entities and background scenes. Before you write each stepwise description, you must follow these instructions:
1. Each step prompt must contain only a single motion or action.
2. Each step prompt must include all relevant objects and describe the environment scene.
3. Make sure each step prompt must be easy described by a shot video cilp of 4 seconds at 4fps.
4. Gives 4 steps in total.
5. The output must not contain the word "camera".
6. The output must not contain the word "same".

Use the following format: [step_1: [prompt, entities, background]; step_2: [prompt, entities, background]; â€¦ step_n: [prompt, entities, background]]

The example of output:
[step_1: [A woman walks along a village road; entities: woman; background: a picturesque coastal village with quaint houses and a view of the sea]]
[step_2: [The woman's hair gently blows in the sea breeze; entities: woman; background: a picturesque coastal village with quaint houses and a view of the sea]]
[step_3: [The woman carries a basket filled with colorful flowers; entities: woman, basket, colorful flowers; background: a picturesque coastal village with quaint houses and a view of the sea]]
...

Provide stepwise prompts for the text prompt:
